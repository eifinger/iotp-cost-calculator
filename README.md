# watson-iot-car-simulator
An application which simulates the output of an OBD2 port and publishes the information to the IBM Watson IoT Platform.

Idea from watson-iot-sensor-simulator.mybluemix.net.
This will allow you to send simulated car data to your own IoT Platform without having to deploy your own version of this app.


Deployment Instructions:
> git clone<br>
> npm install<br>
> cf push
